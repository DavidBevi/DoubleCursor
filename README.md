# DoubleCursor

To compare documents I open them side by side, then I send them the same input to move them in unison.

I made **DoubleCursor** to help me. It's a portable exe that automates moving the mouse, clicking, repeating the key-press, moving back the mouse, clicking again in the original sub-window.

It works with Up/Down Left/Right PgUp/PgDown Home/End

Press ESC to exit the program
