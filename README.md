# DoubleCursor (Beta)

To compare documents I open them side by side, then I send them the same input to move them in unison.

I made **DoubleCursor** to help me. It's a portable exe that automates moving the mouse + clicking, repeating the key-press, moving back the mouse + clicking.

It works with scrollwheel + Up/Down/Left/Right + PgUp/PgDown + Home/End.

Press ESC to exit the program.

Start with the mouse in the left (sub-)window.

**Note**: with scrollwheel it work 100%, but the other buttons sometimes are sent to only one (sub-)window. I don't know why.
